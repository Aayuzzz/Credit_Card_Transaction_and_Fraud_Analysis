💳 Credit Card Fraud Transaction Analysis
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing credit card transaction data to identify fraud patterns and extract meaningful insights. The dataset was cleaned, explored, and visualized to understand transaction behavior, high-risk merchants, fraud trends, and customer activity.

The project is designed for data analysis, SQL practice, and Power BI dashboarding, making it suitable for academic submissions and portfolio showcasing.
